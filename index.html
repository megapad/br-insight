       Welcome to Blade Runner Insight - a site dedicated to the analysis of Blade Runner. Whether you are a hardcore fan or not, I believe you will find the articles and essays here both entertaining and enlighting.

      <p>
       Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir dystopian science fiction film, based on the 1968 novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" by Philip K. Dick.
      </p>
      <p>
       It depicts a grim futuristic Los Angeles, in which genetically engineered androids, called replicants, are banned from Earth and are exclusively used for all kinds of dangerous work on off-world colonies. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and "retired" by special police operatives known as "Blade Runners".
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1993, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Blade Runner is now regarded by many critics as one of the best science fiction films ever made.
